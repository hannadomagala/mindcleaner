## Stay focused
Ever felt like there is too much going inside your head?<br/>
I know you did, we all did.

## Get Things Done
GTD is a time management method described by David Allen in 2001.<br/>
It may seem a little bit complicated on the outside, but at the end it's very simple, and you can apply different versions of it to your life. If you're interested in more details, go get [some read](https://hamberg.no/gtd/). <br/><br/>

## MindCleaner
This is a very simple tool, which helps you apply GTD methology.<br/>
It requires workflow as follow: <br/>
* Put everything that prevents you from being focused straight to the "Inbox". <br/>Every thought should be simple and short. Don't focus on editing, just write it down and stop thinking about it.
* Do revisions! Make sure to sit every day and analyze every thought you wrote down by converting it to task.
* When you do your task, search for another one by its @contexts. <br/>It will help you do everything faster. <br/>For example, when you call your grandma, search for @phone tasks, to do everything at once.<br/><br/>
